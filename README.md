### Implementing GEOMOD in Python for Land Cover Prediction

This module replicates the functionality of Terrset's GEOMOD tool for predicting land cover change. EOMOD, a land-use change model developed by Pontius et al. in 2001, simulates transitions between two states, emphasizing both quantity and spatial distribution of change.
